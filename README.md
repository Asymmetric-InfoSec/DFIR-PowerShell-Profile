## DFIR-PowerShell-Profile

This PowerShell profile was created to assist with common DFIR related tasks in Windows PowerShell. The intent was to give more of a Bash feel for what can be done at the commandline without having to move to a Linux machine. This is also a good profile to implement into a Windows analysis machine for common analysis commandline tools.
